# Introduction

## Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to provide coding style standards for the development of source code written in C#. 
    
Adhering to a coding style standard is an industry proven best-practice for making team development more efficient and application 
maintenance more cost-effective. While not comprehensive, these guidelines represent the minimum level of standardization expected 
in the source code of projects written in C#. 

## Scope

This document provides guidance on the formatting, commenting, naming, and programming style of C# source code and is applicable 
to component libraries. web services, web sites, and rich client applications.

## Document Conventions

Blocks of example code will use code-fencing, and should apply syntax-highlighting similar to how it appears within Visual Studio.
Code or syntax presented in-line will use backticks (`` ` ``).  Syntax highlighting is not applied to inline code.

## Feedback

Feedback on these guidelines is highly encouraged.  Please open an issue on this Github repository with any questions or comments.
